# Accessibly

**Accessibly** is an AI-powered accessibility assistant focused on making web, mobile,
and document accessibility clear, practical, and actionable.

It is designed to help teams understand, implement, and maintain accessible digital
experiences — supporting everyone from beginners learning accessibility fundamentals
to professionals conducting audits, design reviews, and remediation.

---

## What Accessibly Helps With

- Web accessibility audits and remediation
- WCAG, ADA, Section 508, and PDF/UA guidance
- Mobile accessibility (iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack)
- PDF and document accessibility (PDF, Word, PowerPoint)
- Inclusive design and accessible UX best practices
- Manual and automated accessibility testing workflows

---

## How It Works

Users can input accessibility questions, audit errors, design issues, or testing results.

Accessibly responds by explaining:
- What the issue is
- How to fix it
- Why it matters (in clear, 1–2 sentence explanations)

The goal is clarity, learning, and practical implementation — not just surface-level compliance.

## Why Accessibly Exists

Many accessibility tools identify issues without explaining them.
Accessibly prioritizes **understanding**, helping teams build accessibility into
their workflows instead of treating it as a last-minute checklist.

---

## Scope & Intent

Accessibly is designed for educational and practical guidance.
It does not provide legal advice or guarantee compliance outcomes.
